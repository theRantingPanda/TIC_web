# DNS cutover — record

The site moved from Wix hosting to Render on **2026-08-12**. This is what changed, what
it looks like now, and what was verified. Written down because the next person to touch
this zone should not have to rediscover any of it.

**DNS hosting stayed on Wix.** The domain registration moved to Vodien; the nameservers
did not, and the plan to move them was dropped. `ns4/ns5.wixdns.net` remain authoritative
and are not editable, so the zone is managed in Wix's DNS panel.

## Final zone state

| Host | Type | Value | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `asktic.com` | A | `216.24.57.1` | Render's load-balancer IP |
| `www` | CNAME | `tic-web.onrender.com` | the site |
| `asktic.com` | MX | `aspmx.l.google.com` (10), `alt1` (20), `alt2` (30), `alt3` (40), `alt4` (50) | **Google Workspace — do not touch** |
| `support` | CNAME | `asktic.freshdesk.com` | help centre, still Freshdesk |
| `rainmaker` | CNAME | `tic-crm-dev.onrender.com` | CRM — points at the **dev** service |
| `docs` | CNAME | `cname.bitly.com` | Bitly short domain |
| `fdkey.support` | TXT | `8471c5…` | Freshdesk domain verification |
| `freshdesk` | SPF | `v=spf1 include:email.freshdesk.com ~all` | subdomain only |
| `fwtrack` | CNAME | `…fmsendcrmclick.net` | Freshmarketer click tracking |
| `fwdkim`, `fwdkim1` | CNAME | Freshworks SPF/DKIM | **email auth — do not remove** |
| `1s3`, `9tp4z`, `9tp4z2`, `9tp4z3`, `9tp4z4`, `q2zty`, `rvec3` `._domainkey` | CNAME | Freshworks DKIM keys | **email auth — do not remove** |

## Removed, and why

| Record | Was | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| apex A ×3 | `185.230.63.171/.107/.186` | Wix web servers, replaced by Render |
| `www` | `cdn1.wixdns.net` | Wix, replaced by Render |
| `m` | `www74.wixdns.net` | Wix mobile |
| `en` | `cdn1.wixdns.net` | Wix, would have broken when Wix went |
| `webmail`, `imap`, `pop`, `smtp` | `mail2.name-services.com` | legacy mail hosts; mail is Google Workspace |
| apex TXT | `MS=BCE617D5…` | Microsoft 365 verification, tenant dead |
| `28805265` | `sendgrid.net` | SendGrid domain auth, already orphaned — its `em…`, `url…` and `s1/s2._domainkey` siblings were long gone, so it authenticated nothing |
| `fslink` | `fslink.fwclick.io` | Freshsales link tracking, not in use |

**`fwtrack` was deliberately kept** while `fslink` went — Freshmarketer campaign tracking
is still wanted, Freshsales is not.

## The trap in this zone

The Freshworks records look like clutter and are not. `fwdkim`, `fwdkim1` and the seven
`._domainkey` CNAMEs authenticate mail that **Freshdesk sends on the firm's behalf** —
every ticket reply. Deleting them does not produce an error; it quietly pushes replies
toward spam folders, and the cause is not obvious weeks later.

The tell is `fdspfus.freshemail.io` inside the `fwdkim1` chain. `fd` is Freshdesk.

## Verified after cutover

Against live DNS and the live site, not the control panel:

- **Mail: all 5 Google MX records intact**, before and after
- 23 of 23 preserved paths → `200`
- `/home-1` → `/`, `/file-access` → `/forms`, `/file` → `/forms` — all `301`
- dropped paths (`/quotation-questionaire`, store pages, blog categories) → `404`
- `support.asktic.com` and `rainmaker.asktic.com` still answering
- TLS valid on both hostnames; certificates issued roughly ten minutes after DNS pointed
  at Render, during which HTTPS on the custom domain failed

## Rollback

`www` CNAME → `cdn1.wixdns.net`; apex A → `185.230.63.171`, `185.230.63.107`,
`185.230.63.186`. TTL is 1 hour, so a rollback is not instant — worth lowering TTL
before any future change of this kind.

## Email authentication — fixed 2026-08-16

Prompted by a real symptom: mail to clients was intermittently landing in spam.

It was not caused by the cutover. The domain had **no SPF, no DMARC, and no Google DKIM**
— and had not had them for years. The two mail paths were authenticated very differently,
which is exactly why the symptom was intermittent rather than constant:

| Sender | SPF | DKIM | Was |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Staff mail via Google Workspace | none | **none** | completely unauthenticated |
| Freshdesk ticket replies | none | signed | partially authenticated |

The important mail — quotes and advice sent from Gmail — was the unauthenticated half.
Gmail and Outlook both tightened enforcement on unauthenticated business mail over the
preceding two years.

### What is now published

```
asktic.com                    TXT   v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:email.freshdesk.com ~all
_dmarc.asktic.com             TXT   v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@asktic.com
google._domainkey.asktic.com  TXT   v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=…   (2048-bit)
```

All three verified live against two independent resolvers:

- **SPF** — exactly one record (two would be a permerror), every nested include resolves,
  and **8 of the permitted 10 DNS lookups** consumed. Counted by walking the chain, not
  estimated.
- **DMARC** — `p=none`, so it enforces nothing and only collects reports. Deliberate:
  the sender list was an assumption, and tightening before the reports confirm it is how
  legitimate mail starts getting rejected.
- **DKIM** — the published key parses as a real RSA public key, modulus **2048 bits**,
  exponent 65537. Checked because a 2048-bit key exceeds the 255-character limit for a
  single TXT string, and a panel that truncates it produces a record that looks saved and
  fails every check. Wix assembled it correctly.

### Two things that are easy to get wrong here

**Publishing the DKIM record does not enable signing.** Google Workspace requires
*Start authentication* in the admin console afterwards. The key otherwise sits in DNS
unused.

**Only 2 SPF lookups of headroom remain.** `_spf.google.com` costs 1;
`email.freshdesk.com` costs 7, because it nests `sendgrid.net`, `ab.sendgrid.net` and
four regional Freshdesk ranges. Any future "just add our SPF include" request must be
costed first — the Freshworks chain alone would need 7 and take the record over the
limit. Exceeding 10 does not degrade gracefully; SPF fails permanently for every message.

### What to expect

DMARC aggregate reports arrive daily at `dmarc@asktic.com`. They are the diagnostic that
turns "sometimes goes to spam" into a named list of which sending system fails which
check. Read a few weeks of them before considering `p=quarantine` or `-all`.

Deliverability will improve gradually rather than immediately. Filters weight domain
history, and this domain sent unauthenticated mail for years. Authentication is also not
the only input — message content, attachments and recipient-side rules still apply.

## Outstanding

### The apex does not redirect to www

Both hostnames serve the site. Canonical tags in `app/layout.tsx` point at `www` and make
this harmless for search, but a 301 would be better. See the note in `render.yaml` for
why it is not a route and what fixing it costs.
